> add venv, git, django (pip), empty django project.
> add pages app (to hold homepage)
> install pages app (settings.py)
> run migrations
> Add templates folder and configure it in settings.py
> Test templates folder by adding homepage to pages app (homepage view can be just TemplateView)
- (run check: success)

> add template inheritance
> add tests for home route (commit - new repo)
> mkdir project level static folder
> add static folder var to settings.py
> added navbar (needs heavy editing) (commit) (PROBLEM)

> add background image (PROBLEM)
- (background was added after a lot of trouble. not sure if i used the correct way. needs more research later.)

- navbar still has problems (PROBLEM)

> add accounts app
> add accounts app to installed_apps
- accounts app must use django's builtin auth app for (login, logout, signup)
> custom user model must be added. (in accounts/models.py - AbstractUser should be inherited)
- it is recommended by django's doc that using a customized user model (that is based on default User model) is better
> point AUTH_USER_MODEL to our new custom user in settings.py
- there are two ways new users will enter database, from signup page or through admin. both require a form.
- this is aslo supported by doc, the following are tied to user and need to be re-written or extended to work with custom user model
- UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm
- UserChangeForm -> used in admin interface
> add forms.py to accounts.py
> add two new forms to accounts/forms.py
> AdminUser also needs to be updated
- VERY IMPORTANT: UserAdmin is what django uses to render the users list in admin panel.
- admin itself is just a user with high permissions
- note all changes in accounts/forms.py (added CustomUserAdmin and registered it - right after CustomUser)
- admin interface will use this CustomUserAdmin to display the list of users
> python manage.py makemigrations accounts
> python manage.py migrate
- (encountered a problem with migrations. deleted the accounts migration script and ran migrate again. the problem went away. but i have no idea what caused it.)
- (which means it can happen again.)
> run python manage.py check before any other command
- OK, i have officially no idea why it happened. (no wait. william vincent book has an explanation)
- (it is important to wait until after custom user model is created and then running migrations)
- create an admin user to test the interface
> python manage.py createsuperuser
admin, admin@admin.com, 1
> add accounts.urls to main urls file
> commit
